	How to resolve conflicts
		Source Wins: Changes made by the local replica always win in the event of a conflict.
		Destination Wins: Remote replica always wins
		Specified Replica ID Always Wins: No matter who changes an item, the replica with the designated ID always wins.
		Last-Writer Wins: Based on the assumption that all replicas are trusted to make changes and wall clocks are synchronized, allow the last writer to win.
		Merge: In the event of two duplicate items in conflict, merge the information from one into the other.
		Log Conflict: Choose to simply log or defer the conflict.
